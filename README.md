# showing-my-programming-skills-
For those hiring managers who are looking for a candidate with good attitude. :+1:

I was once a business analyst, and I still love to work in the business team. Because I want to better equip myself with technical skills, I start learning Python and MySQL.  

This repository is to show what I have learned in this few months.   

The IPython notebooks I have uploaded:  

1. Practice-Data-Wrangling 
   - This practice is about how to clean the raw data by replacing the missing values by mean or most frequent value; also we can delete the whole rows or columns too many data are missing.
2. Practice-Data-Wrangling-Part2
   - This practice is about how to create bins and dummy variables for analysis 

- Notice that the dataset I used is downloaded from the IBM cousera course
